WHY GREEN DUSTBIN: This item is made of natural materials that decompose through biological processes. Microorganisms break it down into nutrient-rich compost within weeks to months.

PROPER DISPOSAL:
• Place in the GREEN dustbin (wet waste bin)
• Do not mix with plastic or non-biodegradable items
• Can be composted at home or community composting facilities
• Keep separate from dry recyclable waste

EXAMPLES: Food scraps, fruit & vegetable peels, tea bags, coffee grounds, eggshells, garden waste, leaves, flowers, paper napkins, cotton.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: When organic waste goes to landfills instead of being composted, it produces methane - a greenhouse gas 25x more potent than CO2. Proper composting reduces landfill burden by 30% and creates free fertilizer for plants!

💡 TIP: Start a small compost bin at home - your garden will thank you!""",
        
        "RECYCLABLE": """🔵 RECYCLABLE / DRY WASTE

WHY BLUE DUSTBIN: This material can be collected, processed, and transformed into new products. Recycling conserves natural resources, saves energy, and reduces pollution.

PROPER DISPOSAL:
• Place in the BLUE dustbin (dry waste bin)
• Rinse containers to remove food residue
• Flatten cardboard boxes to save space
• Remove caps from bottles (recycle separately)
• Keep items clean and dry

EXAMPLES: Plastic bottles (PET), glass bottles & jars, aluminum cans, steel/tin cans, cardboard, newspapers, magazines, office paper, cartons, metal containers.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: Recycling one aluminum can saves enough energy to power a TV for 3 hours. Recycling paper saves 17 trees per ton. Plastic recycling reduces oil consumption and ocean pollution.

💡 TIP: Check the recycling symbol (♻️) and number on plastics - Types 1 (PET) and 2 (HDPE) are most commonly recycled!""",
        
        "HAZARDOUS": """🔴 HAZARDOUS / DANGEROUS WASTE

⚠️ WARNING: This item contains toxic, flammable, corrosive, or reactive materials that pose serious risks to human health and the environment.

PROPER DISPOSAL:
• Place in the RED dustbin or designated hazardous waste collection
• NEVER throw in regular garbage bins
• NEVER burn or bury hazardous waste
• Store safely until you can dispose properly
• Take to authorized e-waste collection centers

EXAMPLES: Batteries (all types), electronic devices, mobile phones, computers, light bulbs (CFL/LED), paint, pesticides, cleaning chemicals, medicines, thermometers, aerosol cans.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: Hazardous waste can contaminate soil and groundwater for decades. One battery can pollute 1 million liters of water. Electronic waste contains lead, mercury, and cadmium that cause serious health problems.

⚠️ CRITICAL: Never mix hazardous items with other waste. Handle with care and dispose at authorized collection points only!

💡 TIP: Many electronics stores and pharmacies accept old batteries and e-waste for safe recycling.""",

        "GENERAL": """⬜ GENERAL / NON-RECYCLABLE WASTE

WHY GREY DUSTBIN: This item cannot be easily recycled or composted with current technology. It requires proper disposal in the general waste stream.

PROPER DISPOSAL:
• Place in the GREY dustbin (general waste bin)
• Reduce usage of such items when possible
• Look for recyclable alternatives
• Do not mix with organic or recyclable waste

EXAMPLES: Chip bags, snack wrappers, tissues, sanitary products, diapers, rubber items, ceramics, broken toys, styrofoam, multi-layered packaging, candy wrappers, cigarette butts.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: General waste typically ends up in landfills where it can take hundreds of years to decompose. Multi-layered packaging like chip bags combines plastic and aluminum, making recycling nearly impossible.

💡 TIP: Choose products with less packaging and opt for recyclable alternatives when available. Every small choice adds up!"""

For your safety and environmental protection, when the waste type cannot be determined with certainty:

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
• Treat as HAZARDOUS waste (RED dustbin)
• Do not mix with regular household waste
• Check with local waste management authority
• Look for disposal instructions on the product packaging

When in doubt, it's always safer to handle unknown waste as potentially hazardous rather than risk contaminating recyclable or organic waste streams.

💡 TIP: Take a photo and consult your local municipal waste guide for proper disposal instructions.""")
